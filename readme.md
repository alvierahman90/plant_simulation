Plant simulation Preliminary material tasks

1. Change the program so when you enter number of years it doesn't
accept any character input and returns an error with another chance of input.

2. Change the program so when you enter the name of the file to load,
you donâ€™t have to enter the file extension. The program will assume that the
file extension is .txt.

3. The rows are numbered but not the columns. Fix this columns as
letters.
4. Add Wind.
Add a wind factor when seeds drop which can displace all seeds by one position
in one of the four compass directions.

5. Crop Virus.
Add a chance of a crop virus in Summer. A crop virus will destroy a percentage
of plants at random before they produce seed.

6. Validate the name of the file to load. If the file requested does not
exist, give a message and ask the user to enter a different file name.

7. Save File.
Allow the field to be saved to a file and then reopened when the simulation
starts.
8. Adding Rocks to the Simulation.
Currently the rocks are defined as a constant but not used - we can either
allow the user to enter a number of rocks to be randomly placed, or add a random
number of rocks to the field.

9. Add functionality for plants that thrive on or require frost.

10. Changing the seed position.
This includes either allowing the player to set exact coordinates of the seed
(which should also implement column letters), or spawn the seed in a random
position.

11. Every year in winter a bird (B) flies down a column and eats all
seeds in it.
